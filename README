= snips

snips makes it easy to share ruby (or any) files

== lame!

sure, whatever.

== seriously.  lame.

snips was extracted from another project, resir, which uses snips to 
make it easy for users to use and share extensions / plugins

install the snips + load/require/read/eval them into your code, as needed
